**Please use yarn**

**How to use:**
1. Clone or download repo
2. 'yarn install'
3. 'yarn electron-dev' to run development server
4. 'yarn electron-pack [os flag]' to build electron package for your operating system

**Extra notes:**
- Make sure to set your information in package.json before building
- Check electron-builder's offical docs for more options and build info

**Goals**
I want to redo this with CSS Grid and clean up some stuff; also move over to npm completely. I have already done this in a lot of other projects and testing; just need to do it for this template. (2/24/2020)
